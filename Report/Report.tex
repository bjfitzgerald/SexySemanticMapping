\documentclass[conference]{IEEEtran}
% Some Computer Society conferences also require the compsoc mode option,
% but others use the standard conference format.
%
% If IEEEtran.cls has not been installed into the LaTeX system files,
% manually specify the path to it like:
% \documentclass[conference]{../sty/IEEEtran}





% Some very useful LaTeX packages include:
% (uncomment the ones you want to load)


% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/ifpdf
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 5.0 (2009-03-20) and later if using hyperref.sty.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/cite
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation
% can be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/graphicx
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/epslatex
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). The IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


\usepackage{graphicx}
\usepackage{amsmath}


% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

\begin{abstract}
Given RGB-D frames of a scene, it is possible to extract and create a three-dimensional
model of the "object of interest" using Iterative Closest Point (ICP). Once modeling and
segmentation are achieved, the object may then be recognized in a separate scene
consisting of multiple objects, where a semantic map is then constructed to describe the
scene.

\section{Introduction}
Recognizing objects in a 3D dataset is useful for many things.

For this implementation we assume that the objects of interest are placed on a flat table surface and are located roughly in the center of the frame. We believe this is not an unreasonable assumption since it holds in many practical use cases, for example, robot manipulators at a conveyor belt.

The pipeline goes roughly as follows: first a point cloud is obtained from RGB-D images. The background and table are removed to isolate the object of interest, this is repeated for multiple views of the object. Next an object model is constructed by merging the different views using iterative closest point (ICP). 

\section{3D Object Segmentation}

\subsection{Background Removal}
The background is everything except the object of interest. 

A simple way to remove a large portion of the background and much of the noise is to exclude any points outside of a certain radius of the center of the scene. The center is defined as the mean of all points in the scene. Since the object is close to the center of the frame and closer to the camera than the rest of the scene, the point cloud is usually densest close to the object. Therefor the center of mass is usually close to the object even if the object is not in he center oft the 3D space.

To separate the object from the table it stands on we rely on the fact that points on the table are co-planar. We use the RANSAC algorithm to find the plane in the scene that contains the highest number of points. The algorithm picks 3 points in the scene at random and defines a plane that containing those points. Next check the distance of every other point to that plane, if the distance is below a tolerance the point is considered part of the plane. This is repeated for a number of iterations and the plane containing the highest number of points is assumed to be the table.

Despite our best efforts to remove the table and background some noise is likely to remain. To remove point cloud noise we use a metric based on a points mean distance to its neighbors. For every point we find it's $k$ closest neighbors and calculate the mean distance. If the mean distance is above a threshold $s\sigma$, the point is considered to be noise. $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of the mean distance and $s$ is a configuration parameter.

  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{img/hat1}
    \caption{Capturing the region of interest using a hand drawn polygon}
    \label{fig_roi1}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Iterative Closest Point}
ICP is an iterative algorithm that given two corresponding point sets will find a translation and rotation that minimizes the distance between corresponding points. For this implementation we use a variation of ICP that minimizes the distance of each point to a corresponding plane. This variation converges much faster. 

\[
E = \sum_{i=1}^{m}{[(p_i-q_i) \cdot n_i + t \cdot n_i + r \cdot c_i ]}^2 
\]

\[
C = \sum_{i=1}^{m}{
  \begin{bmatrix}
    c_{ix}c_{ix} & c_{ix}c_{iy} & c_{ix}c_{iz} & c_{ix}n_{ix} & c_{ix}n_{iy}& c_{ix}n_{iz} \\
    c_{iy}c_{ix} & c_{iy}c_{iy} & c_{iy}c_{iz} & c_{iy}n_{ix} & c_{iy}n_{iy}& c_{iy}n_{iz} \\
    c_{iz}c_{ix} & c_{iz}c_{iy} & c_{iz}c_{iz} & c_{iz}n_{ix} & c_{iz}n_{iy}& c_{iz}n_{iz} \\

    n_{ix}c_{ix} & n_{ix}c_{iy} & n_{ix}c_{iz} & n_{ix}n_{ix} & n_{ix}n_{iy}& n_{ix}n_{iz} \\
    n_{iy}c_{ix} & n_{iy}c_{iy} & n_{iy}c_{iz} & n_{iy}n_{ix} & n_{iy}n_{iy}& n_{iy}n_{iz} \\
    n_{iz}c_{ix} & n_{iz}c_{iy} & n_{iz}c_{iz} & n_{iz}n_{ix} & n_{iz}n_{iy}& n_{iz}n_{iz} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
}
\]

\[
x = 
\begin{bmatrix}
  \alpha \\ \beta \\ \gamma \\ t_x \\ t_y \\ t_z
\end{bmatrix}
\]

\[
b = \sum_{i=1}^{m}{
  \begin{bmatrix}
    c_{ix}(p_i - q_i) \cdot n_i \\
    c_{iy}(p_i - q_i) \cdot n_i \\
    c_{iz}(p_i - q_i) \cdot n_i \\
    n_{ix}(p_i - q_i) \cdot n_i \\
    n_{iy}(p_i - q_i) \cdot n_i \\
    n_{iz}(p_i - q_i) \cdot n_i
  \end{bmatrix}
}
\]

For point to plane ICP to work we need to estimate the normal of each point on the model. Normal estimation is done by fitting a plane through a small region of points and getting the normal of that plane. For each point we find the $k$ closest neighbors, since these points are highly unlikely to be precisely co-planar we need to fit a plane in a least squares sense. To do this we form a matrix $K$ out of the $k$ points.

\[
K =
\begin{bmatrix}
  p_{1x} & p_{1y} & p_{1z} \\
  p_{2x} & p_{2y} & p_{2z} \\
  &\vdots\\
  p_{kx} & p_{ky} & p_{kz} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\]

To find the normal at each point we perform and eigenvalue decomposition of the covariance matrix of $K$, $cov(K)$. The normal is the eigenvector corresponding to the smallest eigenvalue of $cov(K)$. 

The direction of the normal is ubiquitous so in order to get consistent normal directions across the model surface we need some additional information. For a point cloud obtained by a depth camera we know that the normal should not be facing away from the camera. Assuming the camera is located at the origin we can treat the point coordinates as the view direction. For normal $n$ at point $p$, $n$ faces the camera if $n \cdot p < 0$, otherwise we flip the direction of $n$. 

\subsection{Model Sub-Sampling}
Working with point clouds containing hundreds of thousands of points at full resolution can be extremely slow and offers little benefit. To speed up the processing we subsample the model and reduce it to only a few thousand points before running ICP. There are multiple ways to perform point cloud sub sampling, in this implementation we 


\section{3D Object Recognition}
Given a scene containing one of more objects, we would like to recognize what those object are and where they are.

% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class
% option should be used if it is desired that the figures are to be
% displayed while in draft mode.
